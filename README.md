# Paper supplement: Algorithms and software for computing and utilizing the Dyson series and Magnus expansion

This repository is a supplement to the paper in the above title, containing notebooks, code, and
data, for generating the plots in the paper. This data in this repository was run using Python
`3.10`, Qiskit Dynamics `main` branch commit `948809`, JAX version `0.4.8`, and CUDA 12.

## Running the benchmarking

The paper contains a number of figures displaying relationships between speed and solver
configurations, the data for these figures can be generated from this codebase, specifically using
the `benchmarking` folder.

Each set of data is generated by 3 files with names `*_multiple.py`, `*_single.sh`, and `*_single.py`,
setup to submit jobs in a cluster environment. `*_multiple.py` is a python script which submits
the individual simulation jobs specified by the bash script `*_single.sh`. `*_single.sh` sets up
the required python environment, and runs the python script `*_single.py` to run the simulations
and save the data.

The three sets of data are:
1. GPU odeint parallel saturation test, with script file prefix `odeint_gpu_parallel`. The results are 
   stored in the folder `gpu_parallel_saturation`.
2. `odeint` benchmark data, with file prefixes `odeint_cpu_benchmarks` and `odeint_gpu_benchmarks`,
   with data stored in folders of the same name.
3. Perturbative solver benchmark data, with file prefixes `perturbative_cpu_benchmarks` and 
   `perturbative_gpu_benchmarks`, with data stored in folders of the same name.
